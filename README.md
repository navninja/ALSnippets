# AL Snippets

## I have copied some of my favorite snippets for the rest of you to hopefully enjoy! May these make your coding endeavors easier! 
---
#### Instructions

the best way to use these snippets would be to clone them to your machine, or just navigate directly to the file. Afterwards, prepare for some copying and pasting! 

open up VS Code, and navigate to your user snippets. You can find these by navigating to File --> preferences --> User Snippets

from there, create a new snippet file (global, or alapp), and paste in the snippets!
